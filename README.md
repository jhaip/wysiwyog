A [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35009984/get-stream-from-webcam-with-opencv-and-wxpython) suggested using the [VLC Python bindings](https://wiki.videolan.org/Python_bindings) to show a webcam video in wxPython.
wxPython also wx.Image() with methods to convert to and from a String version of the image.
This could be nice for transmitting the webcam video via ZeroMQ.
